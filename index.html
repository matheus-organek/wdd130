       <p>Hello, everyone!
        My name is Matheus Organek and I'm from Curitiba, Brazil. I really like playing football, but I'm recovering 
        from an injury.
        I have been a member of the Church for just over 6 months and BYU played an important role in my conversion process. 
        I just finished the CSE 111 course where I learned back-end programming in Python.
        And I am very excited about learning web development and applying this knowledge both professionally and educationally.</p>
